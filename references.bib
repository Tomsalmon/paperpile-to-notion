  abstract  = "The study of ignorance, or agnotology, has many similarities
               with studies of absence. This paper outlines a framework for
               agnotology which is shaped by interdisciplinary studies of both
               ignorance and absence, and identifies properties such as
               chronicity, granularity, scale, intentionality, and ontology in
               relation to epistemology as useful for studying ignorance. These
               properties can be used to compare various case studies. While
               not all problems of ignorance are problems of absent knowledge,
               those that are can gain by an examination of the literatures on
               absence and the concept of the privative. The lack of symmetry
               in explanation and representation are methodological challenges
               to studying ignorances and absences.",
