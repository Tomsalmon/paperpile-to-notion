  abstract  = "Epistemic oppression refers to persistent epistemic exclusion
               that hinders one?s contribution to knowledge production. The
               tendency to shy away from using the term ?epistemic oppression?
               may follow from an assumption that epistemic forms of oppression
               are generally reducible to social and political forms of
               oppression. While I agree that many exclusions that compromise
               one?s ability to contribute to the production of knowledge can
               be reducible to social and political forms of oppression, there
               still exists distinctly irreducible forms of epistemic
               oppression. In this paper, I claim that a major point of
               distinction between reducible and irreducible epistemic
               oppression is the major source of difficulty one faces in
               addressing each kind of oppression, i.e. epistemic power or
               features of epistemological systems. Distinguishing between
               reducible and irreducible forms of epistemic oppression can
               offer a better understanding of what is at stake in deploying
               the term and when such deployment is apt.",

               Things That Aren't There",
  author    = "Croissant, Jennifer L",
  abstract  = "The study of ignorance, or agnotology, has many similarities
               with studies of absence. This paper outlines a framework for
               agnotology which is shaped by interdisciplinary studies of both
               ignorance and absence, and identifies properties such as
               chronicity, granularity, scale, intentionality, and ontology in
               relation to epistemology as useful for studying ignorance. These
               properties can be used to compare various case studies. While
               not all problems of ignorance are problems of absent knowledge,
               those that are can gain by an examination of the literatures on
               absence and the concept of the privative. The lack of symmetry
               in explanation and representation are methodological challenges
               to studying ignorances and absences.",
